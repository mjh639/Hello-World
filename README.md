Hi guys I am just starting to Learn Programing as a hobby so go easy on me.

I like how hardware and software intergates together so I am trying to get into development boards. But first I need to learn the the basics electronics then move onto this boards. As for programing or scripting I beleved that I need to learn my computers terminal both bash and zsh first.
